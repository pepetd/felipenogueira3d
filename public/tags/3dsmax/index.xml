I had to write this to find all the meshes that had a specific bone in their skin mod, but not just that! I needed to know which of those meshes had verts weighted to this specific bone.
The main task was to remove the influence of that bone from all meshes not necessarily remove the bone as the engine export strips out any bone that has no vertices weighted to it.</description></item><item><title>Constraint Functions - 3DS Max</title><link>http://felipenogueira3d.com/posts/constraint-functions-3ds-max/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 12:28:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://felipenogueira3d.com/posts/constraint-functions-3ds-max/</guid><description>In the past years I started creating my own library of functions and scripts that would automate a lot of the processes that I often use when rigging characters to speed up the rigging process even more.
I have so many rigging functions that one day I realized I could create an entire humanoid rig in a matter of minutes by using all these functions as long as I had a skeleton created.</description></item><item><title>The Future of 3DS Max</title><link>http://felipenogueira3d.com/posts/the-future-of-3ds-max/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2013 12:26:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://felipenogueira3d.com/posts/the-future-of-3ds-max/</guid><description>Read the comments section of this post on Max Underground.</description></item></channel></rss>
