      <description>Hey guys! Here is a quick snippet to just group nodes under their own little group hierarchie, which will provide us with a driver group and a x_form group. The x_form group is the one that contains the offset values from the parent node while the driver is the group we will use for all connections needed (sometime I even have two driver groups).</description>

      <description>Here is a little function I wrote that will go through all selected meshes and find all the vertices weighted to a given bone. I had to write this to find all the meshes that had a specific bone in their skin mod, but not just that! I needed to know which of those meshes had verts weighted to this specific bone.</description>

      <description>Hey guys! first rigging script for python in maya! pretty simple, it creates a FK chain from selected joints with flags to align the controllers to world or to the Joint. Wrote this script to do Gainer&amp;rsquo;s(Sasktel) spine rig in Maya ( I am re-rigging him in Maya.)</description>

      <description>In the past years I started creating my own library of functions and scripts that would automate a lot of the processes that I often use when rigging characters to speed up the rigging process even more.</description>
