      <description>Here is a little function I wrote that will go through all selected meshes and find all the vertices weighted to a given bone. I had to write this to find all the meshes that had a specific bone in their skin mod, but not just that! I needed to know which of those meshes had verts weighted to this specific bone.</description>
