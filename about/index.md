{% image aboutme.jpg %}

My name is Felipe Nogueira. I am a Character TD/Pipeline TD/Technical Artist in the computer graphics industry. I am a graduate of the Multimedia 3D Computer Animation, diploma program, and 3D for Production: gaming and entertainment , post-graduate program, from Humber College in Toronto, Ontario.

While growing up I became interested in game developing and started creating simple Pascal “play by text” games and simple Visual Basics games. I then moved on to creating several online Text RPG’s based on famous Japanese cartoons at the time. I also started learning the basics of 3D animation at that time, when it came around for me to apply to colleges, I knew I wanted to do one of two things, programming or 3D animation, either would give me the proper training to work in developing games and/or work in CG.

I have now worked with companies all across the world on Tv series, commercials, AAA game titles, prints and game trailers. The ever changing nature of this industry has helped me become a fast learner and develop and aptitude for problem solving. I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for me.
