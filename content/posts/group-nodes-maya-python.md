summary: Hey guys! Here is a quick snippet to just group nodes under their own little group hierarchie, which will provide us with a driver group and a x_form group. The x_form group is the one that contains the offset values from the parent node while the driver is the group we will use for all connections needed (sometime I even have two driver groups).
